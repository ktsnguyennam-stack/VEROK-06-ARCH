# VEROK 06 ARCH — Canonical Keywords

This document defines the **canonical keyword set** for VEROK 06 ARCH.
These keywords are intended for **cross-platform consistency** and
**misinterpretation prevention**.

The purpose of this list is to ensure that VEROK is consistently understood
as a **System Architecture Specification**, not a runnable system or implementation.

---

## I. Core Keywords (Mandatory)

These keywords MUST be used consistently across all platforms
(GitHub, Zenodo, academic abstracts, social profiles, AI indexing).

- System Architecture Specification
- Non-Agentic AI Governance
- Architecture-only
- Inference-time
- Architectural Constraints
- Non-executable
- Not an implementation

**Canonical core phrase:**

> *System Architecture Specification for Non-Agentic AI Governance  
(Architecture-only, Non-executable)*

---

## II. Technical Keywords (Safe for Architecture Context)

These keywords describe VEROK in technical terms without implying
runtime execution, tooling, or behavioral control.

- Inference-time trajectory regulation
- Trajectory dynamics
- Probabilistic AI systems
- Structural governance
- Architectural invariants
- Deterministic constraints
- Semantic blindness
- Non-agentic modulation layer
- Post-training / during inference
- No decision authority

---

## III. Positioning Keywords (Interpretation Control)

These keywords are used to position VEROK correctly
and prevent conceptual drift.

### Allowed / Recommended

- Architectural responsibility
- Reference architecture
- Specification layer
- Governance without agency
- Structural stability
- Constraint-based architecture
- Not behavior control
- Not value alignment

### Forbidden (Must Not Be Used)

The following terms MUST NOT be used to describe VEROK,
as they imply executability or agency:

- framework
- engine
- runtime
- deploy
- plugin
- library
- tool
- model
- agent
- alignment method

---

## IV. High-Level Conceptual Keywords

These phrases are suitable for academic writing, talks, and essays,
while preserving architectural intent.

- Architecture before implementation
- Structure over behavior
- Governance without intent
- Constraint, not control
- Stability, not optimization
- Architecture, not agency

---

## V. Canonical Descriptions (Reusable)

### Short Description (GitHub / About / Bio)

> *VEROK 06 ARCH is a System Architecture Specification for Non-Agentic AI Governance.  
Architecture-only repository. Non-executable. Not an implementation.*

---

### Academic Description (Zenodo / Abstract)

> *VEROK 06 ARCH defines an architectural responsibility for inference-time trajectory regulation in probabilistic AI systems, providing non-agentic structural governance without semantic interpretation, decision authority, or learning.*

---

### Identity Statement

> **Architecture, not agency.  
Structure, not behavior.  
Stability, not optimization.**

---

## VI. Usage Rule (Non-Negotiable)

If a keyword causes the question:
> “How do I run this?”

→ The keyword is incorrect and MUST be removed.

If a keyword causes the question:
> “Where does this architecture belong in the AI stack?”

→ The keyword is correct and SHOULD be retained.
